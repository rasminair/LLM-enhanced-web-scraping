**LLM-Enhanced Web Scraping Pipeline: From Data Extraction to Insight using Ollama**<br>
The web is a constantly evolving ecosystem filled with valuable but unstructured information. This project demonstrates a full end-to-end data analysis pipeline that automates the entire journey—from collecting real-time data to generating meaningful insights. Using Selenium, the system scrapes fresh, live data directly from the source, eliminating the need for manual downloads or exports. The raw data is then processed with an integrated LLM powered by Ollama, which cleans, structures, summarizes, and interprets the scraped content. The result is an intelligent, LLM-enhanced workflow that transforms messy web data into clear, actionable insights, showcasing a complete stack from extraction to understanding.

**Tech Stack:**<br>
**This project is built using the following tools and libraries:**<br>

**Python** — core language for the scraping, processing, and analysis pipeline<br>
**Streamlit** — interactive UI for running and visualizing the workflow<br>
**LangChain** — orchestration layer for LLM reasoning and data processing<br>
**LangChain-Ollama** — local LLM integration for summarization, cleaning, and interpretation<br>
**Selenium** — automated browser scraping for dynamic, real-time data<br>
**BeautifulSoup4** — parsing and extracting structured information from HTML<br>
**lxml and html5lib** — additional HTML parsers to handle different page structures<br>
**python-dotenv** — secure management of environment variables and credentials
